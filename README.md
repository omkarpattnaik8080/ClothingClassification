# Fashion Classification with Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for classifying fashion items. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model accurately identifies and categorizes clothing items from images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Fashion MNIST dataset (or similar)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omkarpattnaik8080/ClothingClassification.git
   
<br>Install dependencies:<br>
bash
<br>Copy code
<br>pip install -r requirements.txt
<br>Usage<br>
Prepare the dataset:<br>
Download the Fashion MNIST dataset or prepare your dataset.<br>
Organize the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.<br>
Train the model:<br>
Execute the training script:<br>
bash<br>
Copy code<br>
python train.py --dataset_path path/to/dataset
<br>Evaluate the model:<br>
Run evaluation script:<br>
