# Fashion Classification with Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for classifying fashion items. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model accurately identifies and categorizes clothing items from images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Fashion MNIST dataset (or similar)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fashion-classification.git
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare the dataset:
Download the Fashion MNIST dataset or prepare your dataset.
Organize the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Train the model:
Execute the training script:
bash
Copy code
python train.py --dataset_path path/to/dataset
Evaluate the model:
Run evaluation script:
bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/saved_model --dataset_path path/to/dataset
Predictions:
Use the trained model for predictions on new images.
