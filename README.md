This project aims to develop a deep learning model for classifying fashion items. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model accurately identifies and categorizes clothing items from images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Fashion MNIST dataset (or similar)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
