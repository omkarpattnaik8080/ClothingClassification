# Clothing Classification with Deep Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for classifying clothing items. Utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model accurately identifies various types of apparel from images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Fashion MNIST dataset (or similar)

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset:
   - Download the Fashion MNIST dataset or use a similar dataset.
   - Organize the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
2. Train the model:
   - Execute the training script.
3. Evaluate the model:
   - Run the evaluation script.
4. Predictions:
   - Utilize the trained model for predictions on new clothing images.
